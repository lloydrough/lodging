lodging blockchain
Im Lloyd. Im trying to get involved in blockchain to make a system that replaces booking.com, expedia.com and airbnb.com
because these systems are not peer to peer the accommodation providor never gets the terms and conditions he wants from the guests.
The guests do room damage and booking.com charge 15% for this "service"
